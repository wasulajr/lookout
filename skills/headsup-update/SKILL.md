# headsup update

Pull the latest headsup from GitHub and apply it in-place. No reinstall needed.

## When to use

- "/headsup-update"
- "update headsup"
- "pull the latest headsup"
- "get the newest headsup version"
- After someone tells you a headsup fix was shipped and they want it

## What to do

Run the update script and let its output speak for itself:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/hooks/headsup-update.sh
```

The script:
1. `git fetch`es to check for changes
2. Shows the changelog (commits being pulled)
3. `git pull`s and applies in-place
4. Kills the iTerm2 daemon if `iterm2-daemon.py` changed — the watchdog respawns it within 30s

If already up to date it says so and exits cleanly. Don't add commentary unless something failed or the user asks.

## If the script is missing

The symlink may not exist yet (e.g. headsup was installed before this script was added). Fix it:

```bash
ln -s ../headsup/hooks/headsup-update.sh ~/.claude/hooks/headsup-update.sh
```

Then re-run.

## Where files live

- `~/.claude/headsup/hooks/headsup-update.sh` — the update script (source of truth)
- `~/.claude/hooks/headsup-update.sh` — symlink installed by `setup.sh`
- Repo: github.com/wasulajr/headsup
